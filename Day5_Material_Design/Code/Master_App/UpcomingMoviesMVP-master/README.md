 Project created for autolearning where I try to apply the new **Material Design** and Android good practices to develop a **MVP (Model View Presenter)** application using a mocked list of **upcoming movies** as the domain of the application.
 
Motivation
----
After see the MVP implementations of:

- [MVPCleanArchitecture](https://github.com/glomadrian/MvpCleanArchitecture) by [glmoadrian](https://github.com/glomadrian)
- [EffectiveAndroidUI](https://github.com/pedrovgs/EffectiveAndroidUI) by [pedrovgs](https://github.com/pedrovgs)

I decided to make my own implenentation using these two projects as reference.
